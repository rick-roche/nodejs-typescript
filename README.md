# nodejs-typescript

My experiments in building nodejs projects with typescript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Just [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/); I generally use the LTS which is 8.11.3 at time of writing.

### Installing

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rick-roche/nodejs-typescript.git
cd nodejs-typescript
npm i
```

### Running the test application

For live reload while developing run

```sh
npm run build:dev
```

Run the linter
```sh
npm run tslint
```

For building the dist

```sh
npm run build
```

To run the dist

```sh
npm run serve
```

## Built With

* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) - The runtime environment
* [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript that scales
